# thesis-template-DESY
LaTeX code for my PhD thesis "Exploring the dark universe with gravitational wave backgrounds". 

It can be used as a template for other DESY students. I used the template https://github.com/leodido/arsclassica and customized it a little to match the DESY color scheme and my own typographic preferences.
