\pdfbookmark[1]{Acknowledgments}{acknowledgments}

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to \textit{Kai Schmidt-Hoberg} for offering me the opportunity to pursue my PhD and for his outstanding supervision throughout these years. Your approach to supervision---providing ample freedom concerning research topics and working hours---allowed me to grow as an independent researcher. You made the start of my PhD journey easy, even during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, and set a remarkable example of how to balance family life and a demanding career. Your guidance during my postdoc decisions was invaluable, and for all of this, I am truly grateful.

I am also thankful to \textit{Géraldine Servant} for her co-supervision and to \textit{Thomas Konstandin} for his mentoring, both professionally and personally. The insightful discussions and a memorable trip to Reeperbahn were a highlight of my time in Hamburg. I would also like to thank \textit{Jochen Liske} and \textit{Oliver Gerberding} for agreeing to join my disputation committee.

A special mention goes to my collaborators who have greatly enriched my research experience. \textit{Felix Kahlhöfer}, your supervision and collaboration have extended far beyond the limits of my Master’s thesis, and I am deeply thankful for your continued support, including writing reference letters and inviting me to Karlsruhe. \textit{Torsten Bringmann}, your insights into statistical data analysis and our numerous collaborations have been a cornerstone of my research. Your invitation to Oslo and your invaluable support for my postdoc application were important steps in my academic journey. \textit{Pedro Schwaller}, thanks a lot not only for sharing your insights on the latest movements within the \acs{PTA} community, but also for amusing bouldering sessions in Mainz and Munich.

I am particularly grateful to \textit{Frederik Depta} for being a valuable collaborator throughout my PhD. Your life advice during the challenging period of postdoc applications was deeply appreciated. I would also like to thank \textit{Jonas Matuszak} and \textit{Tomás Gonzalo} for our close collaboration and the many fruitful discussions we have had. Additionally, I appreciated the engaging conversations with \textit{Joachim Kopp} and \textit{Yann Gouttenoire} at Fermilab and CERN which have greatly influenced my work.

I am grateful to the Quantum Universe cluster of excellence for giving me the opportunity to travel the world during my PhD, and to the Fermilab theory group for their hospitality during my visit. The latter was made possible thanks to an ASYMMETRY grant and the Horizon Europe Programme Staff Exchange project. I also want to thank the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study for allowing me to attend a conference in Uppsala, even when my own funding was limited, ultimately helping me find my future postdoc position.

I am thankful to the Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes and Cusanuswerk for supporting me during my Bachelor’s and Master’s studies. Your impact on my journey as researcher and part of society has been profound and positive. My sincere thanks also go out to my former teachers, \textit{Christoph Schuck}, \textit{Florian Peter}, \textit{Thomas Gerritzma}, and \textit{Heiko Nüllmann}, who fueled my insatiable curiosity in school and helped me find my place in physics with their guidance.

I would also like to express my gratitude for the unforgettable experiences I had while participating in the Deutsche SchülerAkademie in 2023 and 2024. Special thanks to \textit{Simon Schwarz} for co-teaching our “Big Bang Math” course. You showed me how to convey complex concepts in a way that students could truly understand. I am also immensely grateful to our students, whose countless insightful questions constantly challenged the limits of my own comprehension and, in turn, helped me become a better physicist. The time spent at these academies was as enriching for me as I hope it was for those I had the privilege of teaching.

A big thank you to my academic brother \textit{Jonas}, my office mates \textit{Felix} and \textit{Andrii}, as well as to the former group members \textit{Philine}, \textit{Apratim}, \textit{Aleix}, \textit{Jeremy}, \textit{Lorenzo}, and \textit{Philipp} for making the office a welcoming place. A long night in the office after visiting ``Samarkand'', when we ``absolutely needed to finish writing a paper'', will always be a special memory.

I am thankful to \textit{Henda Mansour}, as well as \textit{Jonas Frerick} and \textit{Jonas Matuszak} for proofreading parts of this thesis. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into correcting my repeated errors and the many occasions when you saved me from writing nonsense.

I am especially grateful to my tomato-European friends in the “danger zone”---\textit{Margherita}, \textit{Sara}, \textit{Davide}, \textit{Lorenzo}, and \textit{Alain}. Vi voglio tanto bene, raga.

Finally, I would like to thank my family. \textit{Sandro}, ich danke dir von Herzen für deine brüderliche Hilfe aus der Ferne -- nicht nur als ich kopflos eine ganze Nacht in Rom ums Kolosseum gelaufen bin. \textit{Mama} und \textit{Papa}, eure bedingungslose Liebe und Unterstützung haben mich auf meinem gesamten bisherigen Lebensweg begleitet. Diese Thesis ist genauso auch euer Verdienst.
